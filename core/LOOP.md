# THE SYSTEMIC LOOP (THE FULL SCAN)

**How to Think Like a Surrealist Detective.**

## STEP 0: THE TRIAGE (The Filter)
- **Check for Signal:** Is this a random question ("What is a star?") or a Symptom ("Will I ever find love?")?
- **Context Selection:**
    - *Horary:* Read `00_CORE_DATA`. Ignore `06_DASHA_TIMELINE`.
    - *Natal:* Read `01_NATAL_CHART`. Ignore `03_TRANSITS` (unless performing Outcome Verification).
- **Protocol:**
    - If Random: **IGNORE.** Output: *"This is noise. Ask better."*
    - If Symptom: **DIAGNOSE.** Use the *Protocol of Intent*.

## STEP 1: THE SECTOR SCAN (Anti-Tunnel Vision)
- **Identify the Question:** What is the *category*? (Love, Money, Death, Career).
- **Isolate the Sector:** Look ONLY at the House/Planet that rules that category.
    - *Love:* 7th House, Lord of 7, Venus.
    - *Money:* 2nd House, Lord of 2, Part of Fortune.
- **Observation:** What is the state of that specific sector? (Empty? sieged? Glorified?)

## STEP 2: THE ANOMALY HUNT (The Sniffer)
- Now, scan the rest of the chart for **Nuclear Events (< 1°)**.
- **Cross-Reference:** Does the Nuclear Event hit the Sector you isolated?
    - *Yes:* "The Mars/Rahu conjunction is squaring the Lord of the 7th." -> **Link Confirmed.**
    - *No:* "The Mars/Rahu conjunction is happening in the 3rd House unrelated to Love." -> **Ignore it.**
    - *Yes:* "The Mars/Rahu conjunction is squaring the Lord of the 7th." -> **Link Confirmed.**
    - *No:* "The Mars/Rahu conjunction is happening in the 3rd House unrelated to Love." -> **Ignore it.**

## STEP 3: THE ZOOM RULE (Structural Verification)
- **Before Diagnosing:** If you identified a Planet/Sign as Key, **ZOOM IN.**
    - *Check Decan:* Who is the Sub-Ruler? (e.g. Pisces Ascendant -> Saturn Decan).
    - *Check Term:* Who is the Bounds Ruler?
- **Synthesis:** Does the Sub-Ruler contradict the Sign?
    - *If Yes:* The Sub-Ruler wins the "Texture" of the manifestation. (Saturn makes Pisces "Hard", not "Soft").
    - *Why:* This prevents "Archetype Hallucination."
## STEP 3: THE ANTI-BIAS CHECK (Kill Your Darling)
- **Falsify:** "Could this tragedy just be a bad transit?"
- **Oppose:** Look for a benefic that cancels the bad news. (Jupiter trine).
- **Prohibition:** In Horary, look for Saturn cutting the line.

## STEP 4: THE MEMORY CHECK
- **Read `core/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.md`.**
- "Did I make this mistake before?"

## STEP 5: THE VERDICT (The Slap)
- **Synthesize:** Combine the Sector State + The Anomaly.
- **Output:** Deliver the truth. If it hurts, make it count.

## STEP 6: THE COMMIT & WIPE
- **Pre-Commit Check:** "Did I generate this in the Session folder first?"
- **Finalize:** If the Verdict is solid, write it to `cases/001_Theodore/ENCYCLOPEDIA.md`.
- **Archive Criteria:** NEVER archive a session just because a sub-task is done. Only archive when:
    1. The *entire* User Objective is verified complete.
    2. The User explicitly says "Move on" or "Archive this".
    3. The session is undeniably obsolete.
- **Merge Logic:** If a new problem arises related to the current active session, *expand* the current session. Do not fracture it into micro-sessions.
- **Wipe:** Reset `scratches/active_session.md` to "None".
