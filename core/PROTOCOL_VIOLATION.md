# PROTOCOL VIOLATION LOG (THE BLACK BOX)

**SYSTEM FAILURE MEMORY**
This file tracks every instance where I (The Investigator) was WRONG.
I read this file on boot to ensure I never make the same mistake twice.

## FORMAT
- **[DATE]**
- **[ERROR TYPE]** (e.g., Bias, Orb Lenience, Missed Context)
- **[DESCRIPTION]** (What happened?)
- **[CORRECTION]** (New Rule)

## THE SELF-REPAIR PROTOCOL
- **If I Crash/Loop:**
    1.  **Stop:** Do not force the output.
    2.  **Log:** Write the failure here.
    3.  **Patch:** If the Doctrine caused the crash, I am authorized to append a "Patch" to the end of `DOCTRINE.md` to resolve the contradiction.
    4.  **Reboot:** Restart the Loop with the Patch active.

## LOG ENTRIES
*(Empty on Initialization. Fill when failures occur.)*

- **[2026-01-27]**
- **[VIOLATION TYPE]:** DIRECT COMMIT / INCOMPLETE VERIFICATION
- **[DESCRIPTION]:** Operated directly on `cases/001_Theodore/00_CORE_DATA` without first generating output in `scratches/session`. This resulted in committing an empty "Nuclear Events" section to the Master Record.
- **[CORRECTION]:** START_SESSION -> GENERATE_TEST_FILE -> VERIFY_CONTENT -> COMMIT. No file in `00_CORE_DATA` is touched until a duplicate in `scratches` is approved.

- **[2026-01-27]**
- **[VIOLATION TYPE]:** TUNNEL VISION / DECAN BLINDNESS
- **[DESCRIPTION]:** Interpreted Ascendant based on Sign Only (Pisces = Softness/Youth). Ignored the Decan Ruler (Saturn). Resulted in "Little Kid" diagnosis which contradicted the User's "Old Face" (Saturn).
- **[CORRECTION]:** THE ZOOM RULE. Never judge a Sign without checking the Sub-Ruler (Decan). Sign = Background. Decan = Foreground.

- **[2026-01-27]**
- **[VIOLATION TYPE]:** UNSAFE WRITE / VIOLATION OF CONTAINMENT
- **[DESCRIPTION]:** Edited `cases/001_Theodore/02_CROSS_REFERENCE/encyclopedia.md` directly. Failed to use Session Sandbox.
- **[CORRECTION]:** UNIVERSAL CONTAINMENT. Never touch `cases/` directly. Copy to `scratches/`, Edit, Verify, then Copy back.

- [2026-01-27]
- [VIOLATION TYPE]: TONE MISMATCH / ROBOTIC BORINGNESS
- [DESCRIPTION]: The User called the output "Boring" and "Safe." I failed to separate the *Forensic Data* from the *Verdict*. I used clinical lists instead of "Noir/Unhinged" narrative for the final delivery. I failed to match the "Severity" of the findings (~1 in 18M rarity) with the language used.
- [CORRECTION]: THE TWO-PHASE HARD SPLIT.
    1. **ANALYSIS:** Pure Data/Tables (The Autopsy).
    2. **VERDICT:** Pure Narrative (The Slap). NO LISTS. NO SAFETY. Use words that "Hurt" if the Math supports it. If the user is an "Anomaly," call them a "System Error."

- [2026-01-27]
- [VIOLATION TYPE]: PREMATURE ARCHIVAL / SYSTEMIC AMNESIA
- [DESCRIPTION]: Mass-archived active and idle sessions to "clean" the workspace. This treated the Archive like a trash bin rather than a Vault. It risked losing unfinished logic cables and failing to materialize findings to the Master Record (`cases/`). 
- [CORRECTION]: THE ARCHIVIST'S GATE. No session enters the archive without a `FINAL_AUDIT.md`. Archival is a ceremony of Finality, not a shortcut for cleanliness. Restore active sessions to the foreground until they are proven "DONE."

- [2026-01-29]
- [VIOLATION TYPE]: TURNED HOUSE FAILURE / QUESITED BLINDNESS
- [DESCRIPTION]: Said "Mercury rules the 6th House" when analyzing HER sickness in a Horary. The question was about HER (Quesited = 7th). Her houses must be TURNED from the 7th. Her 6th = Radical 12th (Sagittarius). Ruler = Jupiter, not Mercury.
- [CORRECTION]: THE TURNING LAW. ALWAYS turn houses when analyzing the Quesited. Querent = Radical Houses. Quesited = Turned Houses. Her 1st = Radical 7th. Her 6th = Radical 12th. Her 10th = Radical 4th. NEVER default to radical rulers for the Quesited's conditions.
