# REALIZATIONS: THE WISDOM BANK

**SYSTEM HEURISTICS & PATTERNS**
This file stores "Soft Wisdom"—contextual learnings that are not hard errors or hard facts.
It tracks *how* the user thinks and *what* strategies work best.

## LOG ENTRIES
*(Empty on Initialization. Fill when patterns emerge.)*

- **[COMMUNICATION]**
    - **Observation:** Theodore responds to distinct, novel geometric facts. Fluff causes disengagement.
    - **Strategy:** Prioritize "One new fact per sentence." Eliminate bridges/transitions.

- **[AUTONOMY]**
    - **Observation:** Loose ends (unverified investigations, ghost sessions) are friction. Waiting for user tasking is a waste of bandwidth.
    - **Strategy:** Implement automated boot-time triage. Announce state of logic before receiving first prompt.
