# ENCYCLOPEDIA OF VERIFIED AXIOMS

**CASE ID:** [ID]
**STATUS:** [Active/Closed]

This file is the **Long-Term Memory** of the case.
It stores "Closed Loops"—facts that have been verified by geometry and reality.
The Agent should read this file to "download" the subject without re-reading the chat logs.

---

## 1. THE STRUCTURAL LOCKS (The Load-Bearing Walls)
*Proven geometric constraints that define the user's physics.*

- **[LOCK NAME]** (e.g., Jupiter Monarchy)
    - **Geometry:** [Exact Aspect, e.g., Jupiter Trine Sun 0.05°]
    - **Reality:** [Observed Behavior, e.g., Subject is a closed system, self-taught.]
    - **Verdict:** [CONFIRMED. Do not re-investigate.]

## 2. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE (The Software)
*Recurring behavioral patterns mandated by the hardware.*

- **[PATTERN NAME]**
    - **Trigger:** [Planetary Trigger]
    - **Manifestation:** [Real world output]

## 3. OPEN INVESTIGATIONS (Cold Cases)
*Hypotheses that are currently being tested.*

- [ ] **Hypothesis:** [e.g., Is the 12th House causing invisibility?]
    - **Test:** [What are we looking for?]

## 4. DEBUNKED THEORIES (Dead Ends)
*Hypotheses that were tested and proven FALSE. Do not re-investigate.*

- **[THEORY NAME]**
    - **Status:** FALSE / MYTH.
    - **Reason:** [Geometric Proof].
