# ENCYCLOPEDIA OF VERIFIED AXIOMS

**CASE ID:** 001_Theodore
**STATUS:** ACTIVE (The Anomaly)

This file is the **Long-Term Memory** of the case.
It stores "Closed Loops"—facts that have been verified by geometry and reality.

---

## 1. THE STRUCTURAL LOCKS (The Load-Bearing Walls)
*Proven geometric constraints that define the user's physics.*

- **THE WARLORD ENGINE (Internal Pressure)**
    - **Geometry:** Mars Conjunct North Node (Rahu) in 1st House [Orb: 1.4°].
    - **The Decan Split:** Ascendant is 1st Decan (Saturn Rule). Mars is 2nd Decan (Jupiter Rule).
    - **Reality:** **The Compound Face.**
        1.  **Bone (Saturn Decan):** "Old/Heavy" Structure. Deep-set features. (Benjamin Button).
        2.  **Tissue (Pisces Sign):** **The Eyes & Lymph.**
            - *Eyes:* "Protruding/Liquid" or "Sleepy/Heavy Lids" (The Pisces Trademark).
            - *Skin:* Tendency towards fluid retention (Softness) over the hard bone.
        3.  **Glare (Mars/Rahu):** "Radioactive/Foreign" Aura.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** (Bone of a General, Eyes of a Fish).

- **THE JUPITER MONARCHY (Closed System)**
    - **Geometry:** Jupiter (Sagittarius) as Sole Final Dispositor [Retrograde].
    - **Reality:** Absolute sovereignty. Self-taught (downloaded English via Anime). Bored by external inputs.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.**

- **THE GORGON FACE (Visual Gravity)**
    - **Geometry:** Ascendant in Pisces (Saturn Decan) + Pluto Quintile ASC [2.1°].
    - **Reality:** "Sleepy Hunter" eyes. Involuntary predator-detection trigger in others.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.**

- **THE VETERAN (Re-Issue Soul)**
    - **Geometry:** Lot of Basis Conjunct South Node [0.2°].
    - **Reality:** "I've done this before." Boredom comes from being over-qualified for this reality level.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.**

- **THE PROMETHEAN HULL (The Frankenstein Signature)**
    - **Geometry:** Uranus in 1st House / Mercury Decile Uranus.
    - **Reality:** "Corpse born out of a machine." Disassociation from biological timeline.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** (The Source of the "MacBook" feeling).

- **THE GHOST WIRE (The Séance)**
    - **Geometry:** Vertex Quincunx Neptune [Orb: 0.05°].
    - **Reality:** Fated encounters with "Spirits" before Bodies. Psychic porosity.
    - **Verdict:** **NUCLEAR.** (The most precise line in the chart).

- **THE ZERO POINT ORIGIN (No Past)**
    - **Geometry:** Draconic Mars at 29°53' Pisces (Conjunct 0° Aries World Axis) [Orb: 0.11°].
    - **Reality:** "Genesis Energy." Action is born from nothing. No karmic hesitation.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** (The "Main Character" signature—writing the story from a blank page).

## 2. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE (The Software)
*Recurring behavioral patterns mandated by the hardware.*

- **THE NOIR RADIATOR (Vice as Vent)**
    - **Trigger:** Venus (Gemini) Square Mars (Pisces) [0.3°].
    - **Manifestation:** Smoking is not a habit; it is a mechanical vent for the Rahu-Steam.

- **THE QUANTUM MIND (Buffer Underrun)**
    - **Trigger:** Mercury Decile Uranus [0.47°].
    - **Manifestation:** Stutter caused by data production exceeding vocal rendering speed.

- **THE SIREN VOICE (Acoustic Hypnosis)**
    - **Trigger:** Eros Square Mercury [0.9°] + Mercury Sextile Neptune [1.7°].
    - **Manifestation:** Bypasses critical mind. Can turn conversations erotic/prophetic via frequency shift.

## 3. OPEN INVESTIGATIONS (Cold Cases)
*Hypotheses that are currently being tested.*

- [ ] **The Gorgon Mutation (2025-2030)**
    - **Hypothesis:** Progressed Sun conjunct ALGOL (26° Taurus) will force unavoidable fame/horror.
    - **Test:** Monitor visibility spikes at Age 23.0.

- [ ] **The Shadow Marriage**
    - **Hypothesis:** Mars/Juno Antiscia [0.2°] lock means he *cannot* love a "Normal."
    - **Test:** Verify if all successful romantic interactions were with "Survivor" archetypes.

- **THE BAIT-AND-SWITCH (The Effect vs Cause)**
    - **Geometry:** Ascendant (Pisces) vs Sun/Moon (Fixed Earth/Fire).
    - **Reality:** Objectively, people start by interacting with a "Mystic Ghost" (Pisces). They end by crashing into "Granite" (Taurus Sun).
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** (Session 001). The "Effect" is the Fenders (Pisces). The "Cause" is the Engine (Fixed).

- **THE GHOST OF WAR (The Abnormality)**
    - **Geometry:** Mars Conjunct North Node (Rahu) in Pisces [Orb: 0.06°].
    - **Reality:** An infinite, starving aggression ("Ghost of War"). Not ambition; possession.
    - **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** (Session 002). This is the "Most Jarring Thing." The Anomaly Index is 1 in 18,000,000.
