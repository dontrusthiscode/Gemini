# SESSION: EFFECT VS CAUSE (Theodore)

**Objective:** Investigate the hypothesis: "Astrology is more objective about the Effect (Impact on others) than the Cause (Internal Mechanics)."
**Technique:** Contrast the "External Points" (Ascendant/Midheaven/7th House) with the "Internal Engines" (Sun/Moon/Ruler of Ascendant) in Theodore's chart.

## TASKS
- [x] **Initialization**
    - [x] Update `active_session.md` to point here. <!-- id: 0 -->
    - [x] Clone Core Data (`01_NATAL_CHART.md`, `03_TRANSITS.md`) to this folder. <!-- id: 1 -->
- [x] **The Loop (Investigation)**
    - [x] **Phase 1: The External (The Effect)**
        - [x] Analyze Ascendant (Pisces) + Ruler (Jupiter/Neptune). <!-- id: 2 -->
        - [x] Analyze Midheaven (Sagittarius) + Ruler (Jupiter). <!-- id: 3 -->
        - [x] Analyze 7th House (Virgo) + Ruler (Mercury). <!-- id: 4 -->
    - [x] **Phase 2: The Internal (The Cause)**
        - [x] Analyze Sun (Taurus) + Mars (The Engine). <!-- id: 5 -->
        - [x] Analyze Moon (Leo). <!-- id: 6 -->
    - [x] **Phase 3: The Discrepancy (The Gap)**
        - [x] specific check: Does the Chart describe the "Effect" (Public view) better than the "Cause"?
        - [x] Run `investigate_gap.py` (Script to calculate discrepancies). <!-- id: 7 -->
- [x] **Verdict**
    - [x] Synthesize findings into `REPORT.md`. <!-- id: 8 -->
    - [x] Present findings to Theodore. <!-- id: 9 -->
