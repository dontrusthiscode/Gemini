**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Operator:** Pollux
**Status:** ADJUDICATED

## WHAT TO BELIEVE (THE GEOMETRIC CERTAINTIES)

### 1. BELIEVE SHE IS SICK (Physiological)
*   **The Proof:** Her Womb Ruler (**Mars**) is **Combust** (Burnt) by the Sun (0.67°). Her Illness Ruler (**Jupiter**) is **Exalted** and **Retrograde** in her 1st House.
*   **The Reality:** This is not just "sadness." This is tissue damage, inflammation, or massive rejection in the reproductive/stomach system.
*   **Confidence:** 100%.

### 2. BELIEVE SHE WANTS YOU (The Node)
*   **The Proof:** The **First Aspect** the Moon makes is a Trine to the **North Node** (Your Natal Ascendant) at 1.4°.
*   **The Reality:** Before she worries about the sickness or the break, her soul aligns with yours. It is a Fated Intake.
*   **Confidence:** 100%.

### 3. BELIEVE THE SILENCE IS NOT REJECTION (Mercury)
*   **The Proof:** She tries to connect via **Mercury** (The Messenger). Mercury is **Combust**.
*   **The Reality:** Her words are incinerated. She cannot physically speak across the gap because the "Break" (Combustion) destroys the signal.
*   **Confidence:** 95%.

### 4. BELIEVE SHE ARRIVES (The Outcome)
*   **The Proof:** The Moon (Her) **Rules** Cancer (Where the Illness lives).
*   **The Reality:** She has the authority to "Walk Past" the Illness. The Prohibition fails because the Landlord (Moon) overrules the Tenant (Jupiter).
*   **The Result:** She reaches Saturn (You).
*   **The Condition:** She arrives carrying the Sickness and the Silence.

## SUMMARY
She is a woman in a medical crisis (Mars Combust) who feels a karmic pull to you (Node). She tries to reach out but is silenced by circumstance (Mercury). She eventually forces her way through the illness to connect with you (Moon-Jupiter Reception), but the contact is heavy, burdened, and reluctant.

**This is the Truth of the Stars.**
