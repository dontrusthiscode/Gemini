## WHAT HE ASKED (Distilled)

1. **The Scariest Thing** — What is genuinely terrifying about his build?
2. **Normal vs. Anomaly** — Has he ever felt normal? Does he know what normal is?
3. **Memory Criteria** — His memories before age 12 have a specific criteria. What is it?
4. **Nothing or Everything** — Why does he feel nothing most of the time, then suddenly everything?
