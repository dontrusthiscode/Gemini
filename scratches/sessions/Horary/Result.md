## Doctrine of the Burnt Messenger (Horary Interaction Protocol)
**Chart moment (locked):** 2026-01-12 06:45:37 (UTC+02:00) / 04:45:37 UT  
**Place:** 47.0160975 N, 28.7954969 E  
**Frame:** Tropical • Regiomontanus • Night

This is not counsel for comfort. It is a **protocol derived from the chart’s mechanical constraints**, chiefly:
- **Mercury combust the Sun** in Capricorn (the Messenger in fire, in Saturn’s sign).
- **Moon in Scorpio** (Fall) and **Via Combusta** (15° Libra–15° Scorpio).
- **Translation of Light:** Moon → Mercury.
- **Shadow Lock:** Antiscion(Moon) conjunct Dodecatemoria(ASC) within **0°17′13″**.

No romance is promised here. Only what the geometry allows.

## 1) The Signatures That Govern the Method
### 1.1 The Messenger is Burnt
**Sun–Mercury separation at the question:** 5°51′21″ (combust).  
Meaning: messages are **overheated**, easily mis-seen, misread, swallowed by circumstance (“the Sun”), or rendered awkward by excess heat.

### 1.2 The Messenger is in Capricorn
Mercury in Capricorn means: **weight, restraint, brevity, seriousness, consequence**.  
A Mercury message here must be *dense and bounded*, not social vapor.

### 1.3 The Receiver is Burnt and Fallen
Moon in Scorpio (Fall) within Via Combusta means: **reactivity, scorch, distrust, extremes, self-protection**.  
The Moon does not receive “light play.” It receives **truth-with-limits**.

### 1.4 The Bridge is Mercury (Not Mars)
The chart’s mechanical path is Moon applying to Mercury.  
Therefore the bridge is **contact / speech / message / mediation**, but executed under combustion rules.

---

## 2) The Three Phases of Combustion (Exact Times)
All times below are **UT**, with local time = UT + 2 hours.

### Phase I — Combust (the paper burns)
Mercury remains combust until the Sun–Mercury separation exceeds **8°30′**.

- **Combust ends:** **2026-02-02 12:34:38.281 UT**  
  (Local: 2026-02-02 14:34:38)

**Meaning:** before this moment, direct “normal” approaches are most likely to vaporize or distort.

### Phase II — Under Beams (the smoke remains)
Traditional “under beams” persists until separation exceeds **17°00′**.

- **Under-beams ends:** **2026-02-15 02:03:19.222 UT**  
  (Local: 2026-02-15 04:03:19)

**Meaning:** after combustion ends, clarity improves, but visibility is still imperfect.

### Phase III — Clear (the courier can be seen)
After 17° separation, Mercury is no longer concealed by solar tyranny.

---

## 3) The Burnt-Messenger Speech Form (What Survives Fire)
A combust Mercury can deliver only if the message is:
- **short** (few words)
- **final** (no begging, no spiral)
- **bounded** (an exit is built in)
- **true** (no charm mask)

### The only permitted structure
**One sentence of intent + one sentence of terms.**

Example template (tone must be yours, but the structure must hold):
- **Intent:** “I want to speak with you privately for a few minutes.”
- **Terms:** “If you don’t want that, I won’t press it again.”

This is *Capricorn Mercury*: heavy, clean, and reversible.

**Forbidden under combustion:**
- confessions
- poems
- long explanations
- “why you” speeches
- forcing clarity from her on the spot

Those are fuel thrown into fire.

## 4) The Saturn Boundary (How to ‘Hold’ Without ‘Save’)
Capricorn rising places Saturn as the keeper of the rule.

### 4.1 Definition of “Hold” (allowed)
- Hold = **containment**: steadiness, respect, consistency.
- Hold = **presence that does not demand repayment**.
- Hold = **one offer, then silence** if refused.

### 4.2 Definition of “Save” (forbidden)
- Save = taking responsibility for her interior state.
- Save = pursuing because she is wounded.
- Save = repeated attempts after refusal or non-response.

In traditional language: **without reception, the matter is not yours to force.**

---

## 5) The Gate of Reception (The Only True Consent Test)
In horary, *reception* is the court’s definition of willingness.

**Operational translation into action:**
- If she **makes room** (time, attention, return contact), reception exists.
- If she **does not**, reception is absent.

### One-rule law
**You may offer once.  
If it is not received, you withdraw.**

No second attempt within the combust window. A burnt messenger does not survive repeated deliveries.

---

## 6) The Moon’s Condition (How Not to Ignite the Via Combusta)
Moon in Via Combusta is not handled by brightness.

**Therefore:**
- do not attempt public displays
- do not demand immediate emotional disclosures
- do not corner, chase, or “test” her by pressure

The Moon here does not open under force; it either hardens or lashes.

---

## 7) The Inevitable End of a Burnt-Messenger Connection
Combustion is time-limited, but it marks the nature of the first contact.

### What the chart implies about duration (mechanical, not moral)
- In Phase I (combust), interactions tend to be **brief, distorted, or swallowed** unless executed in the strict speech form.
- Between **2026-02-02** and **2026-02-15**, clarity improves, but the matter remains “in smoke.”
- After **2026-02-15**, the messenger becomes visible; if contact survives to this phase, the structure can be evaluated under clearer conditions.

**This is not a promise of continuation.**  
It is the chart’s clock: the fire either consumes the message early, or the message endures until Mercury can be seen.

---

## 8) Final Summary (One Page)
- The bridge is Mercury, but Mercury is burnt.
- Therefore: **one weighted approach**, not social play, not domination theatre.
- Hold without saving: **offer once, accept the answer, do not pursue refusal**.
- Combust window ends **2026-02-02 12:34:38 UT**; under-beams ends **2026-02-15 02:03:19 UT**.
- If the connection cannot survive the combust phase under strict protocol, the chart’s mechanism has already spoken.
