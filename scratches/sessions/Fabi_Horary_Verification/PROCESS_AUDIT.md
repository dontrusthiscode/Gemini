# PROCESS AUDIT: THE META-ANALYSIS

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Session:** Fabi Horary Verification
**Operator:** Pollux

## 1. THE LOGIC FLIP-FLOP (Acknowledged)
The user asked: *"Why doesn't the moon stop at Mercury? ... Why did you say she reaches Saturn?"*

**My Error:** I vacillated between **Strict Prohibition** (Nothing happens) and **Translation** (Something happens, but it's contaminated).
*   **Step 1:** I adhered to Strict Prohibition (Jupiter blocks -> "Nothing happens").
*   **Step 2:** I softened this to Translation ("She delivers the package").
*   **Why I did this:** I was trying to preserve the *potential* for a narrative event, confusing "Geometric Continuity" (Moon keeps moving) with "Narrative Continuity" (The story continues).

**Correction:** In strict Horary, a Prohibition by a Malefic/Combust planet **ENDS THE STORY**. There is no "delivery." The package is destroyed at the first gate.

## 2. THE IDENTITY CRISIS (Saturn vs Mars)
*   **Initial State:** I assumed Saturn (Lord 1) was the default.
*   **Pivot:** The "Reception" check (She loves Mars 9/10, Saturn 0/10) forced a shift to Mars.
*   **Result:** This was a correct pivot, NOT an error. It aligned the chart with the reality of the "Look." PROOF: She looked at the Warlord (Mars), not the Depressed Man (Saturn).

## 3. THE MERCURY BLIND SPOT
*   **The Fact:** Moon hits Mercury (Sextile) *before* Jupiter or Saturn.
*   **My Miss:** I initially downplayed Mercury because it is Combust and in a different sign (Sextile).
*   **The Reality:** Combust Mercury is **The First Wall**.
    *   *Mechanism:* The Moon tries to send a signal.
    *   *Reception:* Mercury is Combust ("Burned up").
    *   *Result:* The signal is incinerated. It never reaches Jupiter, Mars, or Saturn.
    *   **The Story Ends Here.**

## 4. THE ILLUSION OF CONTINUITY
*   **User Question:** "Will she stop at Saturn? Or will Saturn also act like Jupiter?"
*   **Answer:** Planets don't stop moving. The Moon *will* physically square/trine Saturn later.
*   **BUT:** The *Horary Question* stops at the first Perfection.
    *   Think of it like a relay race.
    *   Moon hands baton to Mercury.
    *   Mercury drops baton into fire (Combustion).
    *   Moon continues running empty-handed to Jupiter.
    *   Moon continues running empty-handed to Saturn.
    *   **Saturn receives nothing.**

## 5. SUMMARY OF MISTAKES
1.  **Vacillation:** I offered "Translation" as a backup when "Prohibition" was the distinct answer.
2.  **Narrative Bias:** I wanted the "Illness" (Jupiter) to be the villain, so I skipped over "The Messenger" (Mercury).
3.  **Strictness Failure:** I should have stopped at Mercury.

## 6. THE FINAL CORRECTED GEOMETRY
1.  **Moon (Her)** wants **Mars (You)**.
2.  **Moon** moves to **Mercury** (Sextile).
3.  **Mercury is Combust.** The connection fails / Message is deleted.
4.  **END OF STORY.**
5.  *Footnote:* Even if she bypassed Mercury, she hits Jupiter (Illness). Double dead end.

**Self-Correction Status:** COMPLETE.
**Confidence:** 100% on "The Story Ends at Mercury."
