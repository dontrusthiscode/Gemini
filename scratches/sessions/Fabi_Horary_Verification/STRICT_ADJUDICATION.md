## 1. WHO ARE YOU? (Strict Rules)
*   **Primary Significator (Legal Self):** **SATURN** (Ruler of Capricorn Ascendant).
    *   *State:* Pisces 26° (Cadent, Weak).
*   **Co-Significator (Body/Action):** **MARS** (Tenant of 1st House).
    *   *State:* Capricorn 21° (Angular, Exalted, Strong).
*   *Note:* Mercury, Sun, Venus, Pluto are also in the 1st, but Mars is the strongest (Exalted).

## 2. THE TIMELINE (The Race)
The Moon must travel from 8° to the end of Scorpio. Here is exactly what she hits, in order.

| Order | Planet | Aspect | Position | Distance to Go | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **START** | **MOON** | --- | **Sco 8°52'** | --- | **HER** |
| 1 | **MERCURY** | Sextile | Cap 16°07' | 7.2° | **INTERFERENCE 1** |

## 3. THE VERDICT: PROHIBITION
**Definition:** *Prohibition* occurs when the Significator (Moon) meets another planet *before* completing the aspect to the Quesited (You).

*   **Does she reach Saturn (You)?**
    *   **NO.** She strikes Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, and Venus *before* she can touch Saturn.
    *   This is a "Multiple Prohibition." The line is dead.

*   **Does she reach Mars (Your Body)?**
    *   **NO.** She strikes Mercury and Jupiter *before* she can touch Mars.
    *   Even if we use Mars as your significator, the aspect is blocked.

## 4. WHAT BLOCKS HER?
The two planets that "cut in line" are **Mercury** and **Jupiter**.

*   **BLOCKER 1: MERCURY**
    *   *Rolodex:* Ruler of Radix 6th (Your Illness/Work/Routine) and Radix 9th (Your Philosophy/God).
    *   *Meaning:* Your own issues (Work, Health, or Philosophy) might get in the way first. OR a message comes first.

*   **BLOCKER 2: JUPITER** (The Big One)
    *   *Rolodex:* Ruler of Radix 12th (Self-Undoing/Secret Enemies) and **Turned 6th (Her Illness)**.
    *   *Meaning:* **HER ILLNESS CUTS IN LINE.**
    *   Before she can connect with your Body (Mars), she connects with her Sickness (Jupiter).
    *   The Trine to Jupiter (19°) happens 1.5° *before* the Sextile to Mars (21°).

## 5. RECEPTION REVISITED (Motivation)
*   **Does she WANT Saturn?** No (Peregrine). She has no motivation to fight for the Soul connection.
*   **Does she WANT Mars?** Yes (Domicile). She *wants* to reach your Body/Image.
*   **Can she?** No. The Illness (Jupiter) stops her.

**FINAL CONCLUSION:**
It doesn't matter if you are Saturn or Mars. The result is the same.
**She is intercepted by her Sickness (Jupiter) before she can reach you.**
The "Nothing Happens" verdict is structurally forced by the timeline.
